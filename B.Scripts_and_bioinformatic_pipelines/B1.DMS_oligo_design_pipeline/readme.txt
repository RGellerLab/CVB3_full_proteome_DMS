B1.DMS_oligo_design_pipeline: Pipeline for the design of synthetic oligonucleotides to mutagenize the non-structural proteins.

1. Codon_changer:
Generates a table that associates to each codon a new codon with:
 1) max number of different bp
 then
 2) max frequency in CVB3 ORF
 and
 an "empty" codon (deletion)

Requires:
CVB3_codon_usage.xlsx 
codon_identity_matrix.csv

Output:CVB3_codon_changer_table.csv


2.Read_tiles_coord
Takes coordinates of tiles and overlaps and generates a table with the 
corresponding sequences

Requires:
CVB3_nancy.fasta
Tiles_overlaps_coord.xlsx

Output:Tiles_overlaps_seq.csv

3.Tile_codon_changer
Generates oligos for each tile with mutations in each position to each of the 20 aas + 
deletion + stop codons

Requires:
Tiles_overlaps_seq.csv generated by script 2
CVB3_codon_changer_table.csv generated by script 1

Output:Oligos folder

4.map_to_ref
Generates a table with number of mutations. 
Trims overlaps for hifi and aligns/translates oligos.
Counts number of oligos.

Output:
mutation_numbers.csv
Alignments folder
number_tiles.csv

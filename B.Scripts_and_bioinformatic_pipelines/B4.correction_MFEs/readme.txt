This folder contains:
	- mutmfe_data: MFE data obtained from the codon_tables_to_MFE analysis (B3 folder).
	- comp_assay_data: experimental data obtained from a competition assay to assess the relative fitness of each mutant vs WT using fluorescent 	viruses.
	- scripts to for the correction of MFE based on overlaps between regions and experimental data.

The output of the scripts is corrected_data.csv containing the corrected MFEs.

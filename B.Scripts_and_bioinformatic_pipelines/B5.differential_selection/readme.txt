This folder contains:

	- scripts folder: scripts 1-5 to process tables, get NGS statistics and compute MFE or differential selection
	- generic_files folder: files required for the pipeline
	- codontables: folder with codon tables from the VirVarseq analysis for each region (p1,p2 and p3)
	- Rproj folder: contains the parameter_file used for each region. To run the scripts use "running_w_parameter_file" selecting the region of 	interest (p1,p2 or p3) at the begining of the script.

The pipeline will generate a different results folder for each region (results_p1, results_p2 and results_p3).
